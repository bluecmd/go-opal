Go library for interfacing TCG Storage Security Subsystem Class (SSC) functions on storage devices.

Supported (or planned) standards:

 * [Core](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tcg-storage-architecture-core-specification/)
 * [Opal 2.0](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/storage-work-group-storage-security-subsystem-class-opal/)
 * [Enterprise](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/storage-work-group-storage-security-subsystem-class-enterprise-specification/)
 * [Ruby](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tcg-storage-security-subsystem-class-ruby-specification/)

Need support for another standard? Let us know by filing a feature request!

## Supported Transports

The following transports are supported by the library:

 * NVMe
 * SATA
 * SAS

Need another transport? You can do one of two things:

 1. You can implement the `drive` interface yourself to talk to your device.
 2. You can file a feature request describing your setup and we can discuss implementing it
